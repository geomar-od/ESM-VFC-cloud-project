# ESM-VFC cloud project

This repository holds configuration files and shell scripts for setting up and maintaining a cloud-based JupyterHub Kubernetes cluster, which is based on the [zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s) Helm chart provided by the Jupyter community.

The major use case of the JupyterHub system specified here is to offer "third-party" scientific collaborators a simple (taking a technical and/or administrative viewpoint) and computing-enabled access to the (non-public) high-resolution ocean model datasets, that we usually produce and analyze on high-performance computing systems.

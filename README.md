# ESM-VFC cloud project

This repository holds configs and helper scripts to set up and operate a cloud-based JupyterHub Kubernetes cluster (using the [zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s) Helm chart).
The *use case* of the JupyterHub specified here is to offer "third-party" scientific collaborators a simple (and computing-enabled) access to the high-resolution numerical ocean model data we usually produce, share and analyze across high-performance computing systems.
